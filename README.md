Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/chicago/chicago-energy-usage-2010

File Name: energy-usage-2010.csv

Changed: Copy the source file and change the CENSUS BLOCK to GEOID10. Deleted redundant data in the source data, such as power or thermo SQFT data, STD, mean and other 35 columns. However, due to the poor effect of reducing the memory footprint, it is no different from directly using the source data.

Zip file contains the original folder that I ran to work, the app.R and changed data file "sourcecopy2.csv" are same.
